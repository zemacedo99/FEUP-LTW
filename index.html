            <b>Mancala Game Instructions</b>
            <br><br>
            <b>Rules</b>
            <br>
            <br> At the beginning of the game, each of the playing slots contains beads. There are no beads in the mancalas. The player will redistribute the beads by selecting one of his own play slots to empty. The content of the slots will be droped
            one at a time to the next slots to the right, including the player's own mancala but skipping his opponent's, continuing around the board.
            <br>The players take turns selecting a slot to empty. If a player drops the last bead of his turn into his own mancala, he will immediately get an extra turn. No one can skip a turn. The game ends when one of the players runs out of beads to move
            (when all of his play slots are empty). At the end of game, the player who still has beads in his play slots will move all the beads remaining into his own mancala.
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>Objective</b>
                <br>The player who has the most beads in his mancala wins!<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>How to Play</b><br> 1. Click on one of your own play slots (one of the slots on the second row of the board);<br> 2. If you get a bonus move (the last bead you drop ends in your own Mancala), play again;<br> 3. The computer will make its
                move(s); note that the computer might get bonus moves, so wait a couple of seconds before your next move<br> 4. The game ends when one of the two rows of playing slots is completely empty. note that if one of the players still has beads remaining
                in his play slots at game's end, the computer will automatically move these to the respective mancala.
